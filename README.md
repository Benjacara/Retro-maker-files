# Retro-maker-files

ITS WIP
For Retro maker :)

This was made by me btw and its for emulating the NES, still working on the code btw :)

The screen initializer script is the only script on the server, due to the server being faster to load the screen in :D

PPU = picture proccesing unit

pallet updater is added to every tile (defined by screenInitializer)

pallet updater just updates the tile pixels and palletizes them
